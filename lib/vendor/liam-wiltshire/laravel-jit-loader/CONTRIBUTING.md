This will be more fleshed out, in the coming weeks, but essentially:

1. Code should adhere to PSR-2 standards please
2. Please include unit tests for any significant code changes
3. Please ensure code changes do not break existing tests
4. Changes that don't fit with the project goals may be rejected - if in doubt, ask first :-).
